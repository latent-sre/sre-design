# sre-design ↔ resiliency-skills: deep comparison, findings, and a hybrid plan

A source-level comparison of this repo (`sre-design` / the `sre-kb` engine) with
[`latent-sre/resiliency-skills`](https://github.com/latent-sre/resiliency-skills)
(the `latent-sre` engine + Copilot skill suite), the concrete weaknesses found in each,
and a phased plan to combine their strengths.

> **Provenance of this doc.** Both repos were read end-to-end from source (this one locally;
> `resiliency-skills` from a fresh clone of `main`). Every load-bearing claim below was
> verified at a named file/line or by executing the code — not taken from a README. Where a
> finding turned out to encode *tested intent* rather than a bug, that is called out.

## 1. The headline: fat engine vs. fat skills — and a shared lineage

Both repos are from `latent-sre` and target the same goal: turn a service repo into a
populated, validated SRE knowledge base / `SRE-<service>` repo (Backstage catalog, runbooks,
SLOs, alerts, architecture). They make **opposite architectural bets** about who extracts the
facts.

| | **this repo** (`sre-design` / `sre-kb`) | **`resiliency-skills`** (`latent-sre`) |
|---|---|---|
| Philosophy | Deterministic **fat engine**, thin LLM | "**Thin skills, fat config**, deterministic transforms" |
| Who extracts the facts? | The **engine**, via tree-sitter **AST** parsing | **Copilot**, via 18 granular LLM skills |
| Role of the LLM | A *passenger* in a deterministic harness: enriches engine-scaffolded artifacts, adjudicates judgment calls | The *driver*: scans / maps / assesses / generates the artifacts |
| LLM harness strength | **Mechanical** — citations are hash-checked; challenge is downgrade-only | **Advisory** — skills say "don't fabricate", only schema-shape + human enforce it |
| # of Copilot skills | 1 (`sre-flow-analysis`) + agent + prompts | 18 (`assess-*`, `generate-*`, `map-*`, `publish-*`) |
| Languages today | Java/Spring + .NET/Steeltoe (real AST collectors) | Any (LLM), backed by **8** detection signatures |

### These read as two phases of one evolution, not two rivals

`docs/DESIGN.md` (`§Security & threat model`, lines ~407-439) lists, as *deferred / "Phase TBD"*
work: untrusted-data framing, dangerous-pattern lint, mandatory human review, sandboxed Jinja,
a least-privilege token scoped to PRs-only, CODEOWNERS on prompts/schemas, and pinned+hashed
deps. **That list is, almost item-for-item, `resiliency-skills`' *implemented* security
posture.** The most useful way to read the two repos:

- **`sre-design`** = the deep, deterministic **extraction core**, with security hardening
  consciously *documented and deferred*.
- **`resiliency-skills`** = the **hardened, broadened productization** that executed exactly
  that deferred roadmap — but, going skill-first for breadth, **dropped the deterministic
  byte-grounding** that is `sre-design`'s crown jewel.

So the hybrid is not "merge competitors"; it is **reunite the two halves the same lineage
split apart.**

---

## 2. Two theories of trust

Read end to end, **both systems quietly rely on the human as the real correctness gate.**
`resiliency-skills` says so openly (`needs-human-review: true` is a schema `const`); `sre-design`
implies it (everything non-trivial downgrades to `needs-review`; its LLM challenge oracle is a
hook that isn't wired live yet). Neither's automated gates *decide* "is this claim true."

What differs is how they make that human review viable:

- **`sre-design` = verifiability.** Every claim carries `path:line` + a recomputed `excerptHash`,
  so a reviewer can check it in one click. *Gives the reviewer the tools to check.*
- **`resiliency-skills` = containment + a hard human gate.** The scan agent has no terminal /
  network / write credential, so a wrong or hostile artifact can't escalate while it waits.
  *Gives the reviewer the mandate, and makes review safe.*

`resiliency-skills` has the safe gate with **nothing to check against** (its artifacts carry no
file:line evidence). `sre-design` has **checkable evidence with a breakable gate** (a textual
injection fence, see §4). That gap is the entire argument for the hybrid.

---

## 3. What each does that the other can't

**`sre-design` is the more trustworthy *analysis*:**
- Real, tested **AST extraction** (`parsing/code_model.py`) — per-class scoping, field-type→receiver
  correlation, try/catch swallow detection. 95→101 tests.
- **Byte-grounded provenance** (`collectors/base.py:hash_excerpt` + `validation/provenance.py`):
  proves the cited bytes exist verbatim. (It does *not* prove the claim is true — see honest
  docstring at `provenance.py:4-10`.)
- A **sound 5-layer pipeline** wired in correct order; challenge gating is genuinely monotonic
  downgrade-only with an audit trail (`pipeline/orchestrator.py`, `validation/challenge.py:207-217`).
- **Reliability guardrails** (`render/copilot.py`) — a genuinely unique forward feature: the KB
  is projected back into the developer's Copilot as rules ("don't remove `@CircuitBreaker`",
  "don't swallow this exception — add an outbox") so future edits don't regress reliability.
  `resiliency-skills` has no analogue.
- Substantive differentiating features: `findings` (ranked risk digest), `drift` (semantic diff
  that flags data-loss regressions), `estate` (cross-service co-tenancy detection).

**`resiliency-skills` is the more defensible *system*:**
- **Architectural injection containment**, *tested* with `examples/malicious/{AGENTS.md,README.md,manifest.yml}`:
  the scan agent holds no credential, `needs-human-review` is `const: true`, names are sanitized.
- **Safe-by-construction renderers** — `render.py` (sandboxed Jinja + `tojson`/`sanitize`),
  `dashboard.py` (dict→`json.dumps`), `runbook.py` — all tested with hostile payloads.
- **Fail-closed `redact`** secret gate + an independent second gate (`tools/second_secret_gate.py`
  wrapping `detect-secrets`); fan-out cap (`appnames.py:FANOUT_CAP=20`); supply-chain pinning;
  self-defending generated repo (vendored schemas, least-privilege CI, CODEOWNERS sentinel).

But its **breadth is thinner than it looks**: the "18 skills / fat config" are `SKILL.md`
stubs + Copilot reasoning, backed by only **8 deterministic signatures** (`lib/signatures/`:
5 frameworks, 3 messaging systems, 0 datastores/infra/observability). It defines 17 artifact
*shapes* comprehensively; the *detection* behind them is LLM reasoning, not implemented detectors.

---

## 4. Verified findings

### `sre-design` — bugs found (fixed on this branch)

These were verified at the source and **fixed with regression tests** in the same change as this doc:

1. **Swallow false-positive** (`parsing/code_model.py`): `"log" in (recv+meth)` flagged
   `catalog`/`backlog`/`dialog` receivers in a catch block as logged-and-swallowed, seeding a
   spurious data-loss claim — which then propagated into a wrong *reliability guardrail* in the
   developer's editor. **Fixed:** match log-level method names / logger-shaped receivers; also
   now inspects every catch clause, not just the first (a logged-swallow in a later catch was
   previously missed).
2. **Ungrounded attribution in the deterministic path** (`collectors/java_spring/flow_builder.py`):
   `_match_pub`/`_match_repo` fell back to the *first* publisher/repo when a receiver's type was
   unresolved, fabricating a wrong-but-confident sink. **Fixed:** fall back only to a *sole*
   unambiguous candidate; never guess among several. (The sole-candidate fallback is intended
   and tested.)
3. **`findings.py` didn't understand `"critical"`** (`reporting/findings.py`): `_SEV_RANK` had
   no `critical` entry, so a co-tenancy `severityHint: critical` finding sorted to rank 9 (below
   `info`) and wasn't counted in the high/medium tally — the most severe findings were
   effectively hidden. **Fixed:** `critical` ranks above `high` and counts as high-or-above.
4. **Mermaid output not sanitized** (`render/diagrams.py`): untrusted strings (service name and
   REST path from annotations, resource/binding names from `manifest.yml`) were interpolated raw
   into Mermaid labels/messages/relations — a render-integrity / diagram-spoofing gap.
   `resiliency-skills` hardened exactly this. **Fixed:** sanitize the metacharacters that could
   break out of a label or inject diagram syntax (node ids were already sanitized).

### `sre-design` — weaknesses noted (now closed in Phase 1/2; see §8)

These were the gaps the hybrid set out to fix; all are implemented in code as of 2026-06-07:

- **Injection fence** (`synth/context_pack.py`) — fence/sentinel runs in cited excerpts *and*
  paths are now defanged, so a hostile source file can't close the `<<<UNTRUSTED …>>>` block
  early. *(Was: textual and breakable.)*
- **Publish path** (`publish/forge/github.py`) — the token is kept out of `git` argv
  (env-injected auth) and live publishes are confined to a `publish.allowed_repos` allowlist
  (empty = block-all). *(Was: token in argv, no allowlist.)*
- **Status-aware gates** (`validation/crossref.py`, `scoring/readiness.py`) — a verified
  artifact citing a non-verified referent is downgraded to a fixpoint; artifact-presence
  readiness credits only verified coverage. *(Was: name-only resolution, status-blind grade.)*
- **Provenance path-confinement** (`validation/provenance.py`) — evidence paths must resolve
  inside the repo root (`is_relative_to`); `../`/absolute escapes are rejected. *(Was: none.)*

### Findings that turned out to be *tested intent*, not bugs (calibration)

- `scoring/risk.py`: the `"low"` severity branch is **unreachable**, but `test_risk.py:21-23`
  asserts a contained single-flow dependency is `medium` — the design **deliberately floors a
  tracked dependency at medium**. Dead code, not wrong output; left as-is. (The real bug nearby
  was the `findings.py` `"critical"` handling, fixed above.)
- `estate/topology.py` hard-codes `severityHint: "critical"` for co-tenancy, which `test_estate.py:44`
  asserts. Defensible for a shared datastore with data loss; the genuine downstream bug was that
  `findings.py` mis-ranked that `critical`, now fixed.

### `resiliency-skills` — weaknesses

- **No file:line evidence in any artifact.** Provenance is `repo/commit/scanDate/skill`; even the
  optional `source.path` is unenforced and `RunbookSpec` has no source field. The human-review
  gate has nothing to verify against — the structural epistemic gap.
- **Schemas are permissive on substance** — `Resiliency` passes with empty `patterns`+`gaps`;
  `RunbookSpec` requires only `title`. Structure is gated; truth is not.
- **Breadth is thin** (8 signatures); coverage rides on Copilot reasoning quality.
- Minor/unverified: `renovate.json` action-pinning claim (T7) couldn't be confirmed from the
  repo; the "redact + detect-secrets are complementary" claim has no rule matrix.

### Confirmed strengths (both)

- `sre-design`'s **pipeline plumbing is correct** (5 layers in order; challenge monotonic;
  audit trail). The weaknesses are gate *strength*, not wiring.
- `resiliency-skills`' **output layer is safe-by-construction and hostile-payload-tested**;
  6/8 threats in `docs/security.md` are code-backed, 2 are honest deployment preconditions.

---

## 5. Bottom line

- **Most trustworthy *analysis* today: `sre-design`.** Only it verifies a claim against source
  bytes, and only it has real, tested extraction.
- **Most defensible *system* today: `resiliency-skills`.** If you had to point one at a hostile
  repo tomorrow, it's this one.
- **Neither is production-trustworthy alone.** `sre-design` would leak/spoof through unsanitized
  output and a breakable fence; `resiliency-skills` would emit confident, unverifiable claims a
  human can't efficiently check.

Pick by estate if forced to ship one as-is: **mostly Java/.NET and correctness-critical →
`sre-design`; polyglot and breadth-first → `resiliency-skills`.** Otherwise, build the hybrid.

---

## 6. The hybrid plan

**Thesis:** keep `resiliency-skills`' implemented hardening *and* skill-driven breadth, but fence
the LLM output behind `sre-design`'s byte-level grounding + sound validation pipeline. This is
mostly *adding a second kind of collector*, because the repo already pivots on the right seam: a
language-neutral `Fact` with provenance (`models/facts.py`) that collectors emit and the
scaffolder consumes. AST collectors and LLM skills can both produce `Fact`s; everything
downstream (scaffold → validate → render → publish) is unchanged.

### Trust tiers

Ride a trust tier on the existing `Evidence.detector` provenance:

- **Tier A — AST collectors** (existing): deterministic, high-trust. Java/.NET today.
- **Tier B — LLM skill collectors** (new, from `resiliency-skills`): broad-stack, lower-trust,
  **cannot reach `verified`** until grounded.

A router picks Tier A where a tree-sitter grammar exists, Tier B otherwise. On overlap, **AST
wins**; Tier B only fills gaps AST can't reach.

### The non-circular Tier-B contract (the crux)

The naïve "LLM emits `path:line`, engine recomputes the hash" is **circular** — if the same model
produces both the claim and the cited excerpt, the hash only proves the excerpt is real, and a
substring grounding check only proves the model quoted its own keyword (exactly the self-consistency
trap `validation/challenge.py:9-13` warns about). Instead:

1. Treat the LLM as a **pointer/hypothesis generator**, not a fact source. It proposes a claim +
   the excerpt *text* (not a line number — LLMs are unreliable at exact lines); the engine
   *locates* the bytes and stamps `path:line:hash` itself.
2. The engine **independently re-derives** the fact at that location with the *same deterministic
   rule Tier A uses* (AST/regex confirms the breaker annotation is actually there). The LLM only
   widened coverage; the assertion is deterministic.
3. Where no deterministic confirmation exists (judgment calls — runbook-step safety, alert
   appropriateness), route to a **separate** LLM adjudication context (finally wire
   `LLMChallenger`'s oracle) — never self-grade.

### Phases (reordered by everything the deep review found)

| Phase | What | Why first/last |
|---|---|---|
| **0. Fact contract & trust tiers** ✅ | Add `source_tier: ast\|llm` to `Fact`/`Evidence`; a `CollectorProtocol` both tiers satisfy. No behavior change. | Foundation. |
| **1. Adopt `resiliency-skills`' hardening wholesale** ✅ | Architectural scan/publish split (no-credential scan role; scoped publish credential), sandboxed/`json.dumps` renderers, `redact` + second gate, fan-out cap, `needs-human-review` const. | This *is* `sre-design`'s own deferred roadmap. Closes the textual-fence and publish-path weaknesses **before** any LLM breadth is added. |
| **2. Make the trust spine status-aware** ✅ | Fix `crossref`/`readiness`/gating to require `verified` referents; confine provenance paths (`is_relative_to`). | Or Tier-B facts will silently inflate "verified" graphs. |
| **3. Challenge loop (Copilot oracle)** ✅ | Judgment-call claims → worklist; Copilot adjudicates; `challenge-apply` re-gates monotonically. In-process `LLMChallenger` superseded by the worklist (engine stays model-free). | Prerequisite for Tier-B — deterministic grounding is circular for LLM judgment claims. |
| **4. LLM collectors: gap-finders + pointer-generators** 🟡 (gap-finder spike) | `collectors/llm/`. The LLM reads the engine's facts + the cited code and proposes **(a) gaps the engine missed on code we already cover** (the recall payoff — §7.9) and **(b) pointers for stacks no AST grammar reaches** (breadth). The engine re-derives or *refutes* each (§6.3, §7.9); nothing it proposes can auto-`verify`. | Recall on covered estates **and** breadth, both safely fenced. |
| **5. Render-adapter breadth** ⬜ | Generalize `render/` to neutral-intent → adapter; add Wavefront/AppDynamics. | Independent; can run in parallel. |

Phases 0→1→2 are the trust/security spine and are low-risk extensions of existing code; they land
first. Phase 4 was the only heavy lift and the only new LLM-integration risk — and the spike has
since cleared that bar (§9). The remaining order has been revised post-spike from "expand Phase 4,
then Phase 5" to **integrate before expand**; see **§9.3** for the current sequence.

### Lift verbatim from `resiliency-skills`

Ownership/credential boundary (`docs/ownership-boundary.md`); safe renderers (sandboxed Jinja,
dict→`json.dumps`); `redact` + second secret gate; fan-out cap + name sanitization; self-defending
generated repo; supply-chain pinning; `render-adapters` multi-tool breadth.

### Keep from `sre-design`

Byte-level provenance (`hash_excerpt`) + the monotonic challenge pipeline; the AST extraction core;
the `Flow`/`Topology`/`estate`/`BlastRadius` graph depth; `findings` + `drift`; and the unique
**reliability guardrails** that feed the KB back into the developer's editing loop.

---

## 7. Enhancements (second-pass review)

> **Provenance of this section.** A second pass over §6 after re-reading both repos. These do **not**
> change the spine or the phase order — they harden the Tier-B contract and exploit two assets §6
> under-uses: the `drift`/`findings` graph and the reliability guardrails. Each is tagged by value
> and slotted into the existing phases.

### 7.1 Tier-B as a cross-check on Tier-A, not only a gap-filler — **[HIGH]**

§6 rules "on overlap, AST wins; Tier-B only fills gaps." But **all four bugs in §4 were in
Tier-A** — "AST wins" discards a free signal. Instead, on overlap, **compare**: when a Tier-B
claim *disagrees* with a Tier-A fact (the LLM asserts a circuit breaker where the AST found none,
or misses one the AST has), emit a `tier-conflict` finding rather than silently dropping Tier-B.
This is a near-zero-cost detector for Tier-A extraction bugs — it would have surfaced the swallow
false-positive (§4.1) before it reached a guardrail. *Wiring:* both tiers already become `Fact`s;
route the overlap through `validation/crossref.py` and add a conflict rule in
`reporting/findings.py`. *Slots into:* finding type in **Phase 2**; activates in **Phase 4**.

### 7.2 Tier-aware reliability guardrails — **[HIGH]**

`render/copilot.py` projects findings back into the developer's editor as hard rules ("don't remove
`@CircuitBreaker`", "add an outbox"). §4.1 shows the failure mode: a false finding becomes a *wrong
guardrail* the developer is told to obey. Enhancement: **only Tier-A (byte-grounded) findings emit
hard guardrails; Tier-B findings emit advisory notes.** The blast radius of an LLM mistake must
never be a hard editor rule. *Wiring:* gate guardrail strength on `Evidence.source_tier` in
`render/copilot.py`. *Slots into:* **Phase 0** (the tier field) + a one-line gate.

### 7.3 Make the non-circular contract testable — **[HIGH]**

§6.3 is the whole hybrid, but it is prose. Give it regression teeth: an `examples/adversarial-llm/`
corpus where a planted *claim + excerpt* does **not** deterministically re-derive (the "breaker" the
LLM points at isn't a breaker), and assert the engine **rejects/downgrades** it — the dual of
`resiliency-skills`' `examples/malicious/`. Without this, the re-derivation gate can silently rot
into the circular check it was built to avoid. *Slots into:* **Phase 3/4**.

### 7.4 `lib/signatures` as the shared re-derivation rule — **[MED]**

§6.3 step 2 says "re-derive with the *same deterministic rule* Tier A uses" but leaves "the rule"
abstract. Bind it concretely to a shared **signature library** both tiers consume: re-derivation
becomes "does signature *S* fire at the pointer the LLM proposed?" One `SignatureSet` is cited by
Tier-A (AST) and Tier-B (LLM) alike — which also unifies detection config and makes a new language
*data*, not code. *Slots into:* **Phase 0** (define) / **Phase 4** (consume).

### 7.5 Surface the trust tier in human-facing output — **[MED]**

The reviewer's entire job is triage by trust, yet §6 keeps `source_tier` internal to `Evidence`.
Surface it: `findings`, `REVIEW.md`, and the digest should label each claim **AST-grounded** /
**LLM-proposed-then-confirmed** / **LLM-judgment**. It is the single most decision-relevant column.
*Slots into:* **Phase 0** (carry) + `reporting/findings.py` & the publish REVIEW (surface).

### 7.6 Schema-governance specifics (fold into Phase 1/2) — **[MED]**

§6 implies schema hardening (`needs-human-review` const) but doesn't enumerate it. Concretely:
- **`additionalProperties: false`** on every per-kind schema (a positive allow-list). Ours is loose
  — `riskRationale` was addable to `BlastRadius` precisely because nothing forbade it.
- **`ownership: app | platform | shared`** — we lack it; `resiliency-skills` has it and it is core SRE
  governance (who owns this alert/runbook).
- **`unverified-against-live`** flag for claims uncheckable offline (SLO thresholds, live metrics) —
  while **keeping** our `verified | needs-review | rejected` status (a strength over their
  `needs-human-review: const true`, which we *can* improve on because we ground with hashes).
- A **golden-example-per-kind** corpus validated in CI, mirroring `examples/golden/`.

### 7.7 Push-back on §6 sequencing

- **Phase 1 is not purely "low-risk code."** The scan/publish **credential split** is a
  deployment/process architecture (two contexts that never share state, CI wiring, agent config),
  not a refactor. Track its infra story separately so it isn't under-scoped.
- **Phase 5 (render-adapter breadth) is independent of the trust spine** and is the one piece with
  immediate user-visible value and no LLM-trust risk — run it **in parallel, earlier**, not last.

### 7.8 Net

Adopt §6's spine and ordering over the earlier 4-workstream sketch. The two highest-value additions
are **7.1 (tier-conflict findings)** and **7.2 (tier-aware guardrails)**: both turn assets we already
have — `drift`/`findings` and the editor guardrails — into Tier-B safety nets neither repo has today.

### 7.9 LLM as recall booster (gap-finder) — the primary Tier-B mode — **[HIGH]**

**This is the point of Tier-B for a Java/.NET estate, and it sharpens Phase 4.** §6 framed Tier-B
mostly as *polyglot breadth* ("gaps AST can't *reach*" = new languages). The higher-value mode is
**recall on code we already cover**: things the engine *missed*.

The engine is **high-precision, limited-recall** — it emits only what its deterministic rules match
and hash-grounds every hit, so its real failure mode is **false negatives** (a breaker in a shape we
don't match, a swallow through an unusual path, a timeout that simply *isn't there*). That is exactly
the LLM's strength. The division of labour:

- **Engine = precision gate** — finds what it can prove, grounds it (Tier A, may reach `verified`).
- **LLM = recall booster** — reads the *same* code plus the engine's facts and asks *"what
  reliability-relevant thing is here that the facts don't mention?"*, emitting **candidates** (Tier B).

It is the mirror of the challenge pass: **challenge checks false positives** ("is this claim
grounded?"); **the gap-finder checks false negatives** ("what true claim did we miss?"). Together
they bracket both error types.

**Why it's safe by construction.** Most gaps are *absences* ("no timeout", "swallowed here"), and an
absence can't be byte-proven the way a present `@CircuitBreaker` can. So gap-finder output is
inherently Tier-B: it lands as `needs-review` and **can only add candidates to the human's pile —
never auto-`verify`, never delete an engine fact.** Worst case is noise a reviewer dismisses.

#### Bounded gap taxonomy + a deterministic *refutation* probe per category

Not open-ended LLM rambling — a fixed catalogue, each with a probe that turns "absence" into
"absence-where-we-know-to-look" so the engine kills the easy false positives before a human sees them:

| Gap category | Example | Engine refutation probe (found ⇒ drop the gap) |
|---|---|---|
| `missing-timeout` | critical client, no timeout | search `application.yml` (`resilience4j.timelimiter`), client builder (`setReadTimeout`/WebClient `responseTimeout`) bound to that client |
| `unguarded-critical-dependency` | sync dep, no breaker/fallback | is there a `resiliency.circuitbreaker`/`fallback` fact whose target is this dependency? |
| `swallowed-failure` (recall) | catch that drops an error in a shape the AST matcher missed | re-run the deterministic swallow rule at the proposed pointer — **if it fires, promote to Tier-A**; else Tier-B |
| `data-loss-path` | write-then-publish, no outbox/txn | judgment — route to the oracle (§7.3), no deterministic refute |
| `missing-idempotency` | retried non-idempotent endpoint | judgment |
| `undocumented-job` | cron/scheduled work in no `Flow` | is there a `@Scheduled`/Quartz fact for it? |
| `unbounded-resource` | unbounded cache/queue/threadpool | judgment |

#### Recall eval (the dual of §7.3)

§7.3 tests *precision* (a planted ungrounded claim is rejected). This needs the dual: a fixture with
**known, planted gaps** (a client with a deliberately removed timeout) and an assert that the
gap-finder surfaces them. Without a recall eval we cannot tell signal from noise.

#### Noise budget

Rank candidates by `severity × confidence`; cap per run; run the refutation probes above *before* a
human sees anything. A gap-finder that cries wolf gets muted and the whole tier is wasted.

#### The payoff loop: confirmed gaps graduate to Tier-A

The strategic part. A recurring, human-confirmed gap category is a signal to add a **deterministic
collector/signature** for it: LLM finds it (Tier-B) → human confirms → engineer adds a signature →
next run it is Tier-A, hash-grounded, and the LLM moves to the next frontier. **The gap-finder drives
the engine's recall upward over time** instead of being a permanent crutch. (Pairs with 7.4: the
signature *is* the re-derivation rule.)

### 7.10 Worked example — `assess-resiliency` in gap-mode

A concrete first Tier-B collector, so Phase 4 has an instance, not just a category.

- **Targets:** every critical synchronous dependency the engine knows about — `Dependency` facts and
  `http-egress` flow steps — that has **no** `resiliency.circuitbreaker`/`fallback`/timeout fact.
- **Input (framed untrusted via `synth/context_pack.py`):** those dependency/flow facts + the cited
  client and config code. The LLM is told the engine's coverage so it doesn't re-report hits.
- **LLM emits (pointer, not fact):** `{category: unguarded-critical-dependency, target: inventory-client,
  excerpt: "<the call site text>", rationale: "no timeout/breaker around a sync call to a critical dep"}`.
- **Engine refutes or stamps:** locate the excerpt → `path:line:hash`; run the `missing-timeout` /
  `unguarded-critical-dependency` probes (search `application.yml` + the client builder). Found ⇒ drop
  (false gap). Not found ⇒ emit a Tier-B `BlastRadius`/finding `status: needs-review`,
  `source_tier: llm`, with `checked: [application.yml, <client>.java]` so the absence is honest.
- **Cross-check (§7.1):** if the engine *did* emit resiliency for that target but the LLM flags it →
  `tier-conflict` (may reveal an engine bug). **Guardrails (§7.2):** this finding is advisory in the
  editor, never a hard "don't remove" rule, precisely because it's Tier-B.
- **Graduation (§7.9 loop):** if "missing-timeout on WebClient builders" recurs and is confirmed, add
  a deterministic timeout-config collector — it becomes Tier-A and drops out of the LLM's frontier.

## 8. Implementation status (2026-06-07)

Tracked against the §6 phase table. Legend: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not started. **178 tests
passing, ruff-clean.** Every claim below was re-verified at file:line on 2026-06-07 (the deep
re-audit in §9) — no drift found; the only corrections were *additions* for behaviors the code
had but this section under-documented (folded in where they belong).

### Phase 0 — Fact contract & trust tiers ✅

- `Evidence.source_tier` (`"ast"` default | `"llm"`) on the provenance model + the envelope schema
  (optional `enum`, so artifacts without it still validate).
- `ScanContext.evidence(...)` stamps `source_tier`; a keyword-only param lets a future Tier-B
  collector pass `"llm"`.
- `CollectorProtocol` (runtime-checkable) that both shapes — `collect(ctx)` and `collect(ctx, fs)` —
  satisfy.
- Per-artifact `tier` + a `by_tier` roll-up surfaced in the validation report.
- Pure plumbing: no artifact status/confidence/content changed.

### Phase 1 — Adopt `resiliency-skills`' hardening ✅ (code-complete)

Both weaknesses §6 assigns to Phase 1 are closed, and the §6 hardening list is implemented in code:

- **Non-escapable injection fence** (`synth/context_pack.py`) — fence/sentinel runs in cited
  excerpts + paths are defanged, so hostile source can't break out of the untrusted block (§4).
- **Sanitized renderers** (`render/copilot.py`) — untrusted values in guardrails/runbooks are
  flattened + de-backticked (diagrams were already sanitized).
- **Publish-repo allowlist** (`publish/forge/github.py`, `publish.allowed_repos`) — live publishes
  confined to an allowlist; empty list = block-all by default (§4 publish path).
- **Token out of `git` argv** — tokenless remote + auth via env config (`GIT_CONFIG_*` /
  `http.extraheader`).
- **redact + second gate** (`security/secret_scan.py`) — `redact_tree()` scrubs the staged tree
  before `enforce_secret_gate` verifies it.
- **Fan-out cap** (`publish.max_artifacts`) — refuses a runaway/compromised PR tree.
- **Dangerous-pattern safety lint** (`validation/safety.py`) — artifact specs are scanned for
  shell-pipe-to-network, `rm -rf`, TLS/auth-disable, and dynamic-eval patterns; a hit forces the
  artifact to `needs-review` in the orchestrator gate even when provenance is clean (a de-facto
  gate-strength layer, surfaced by the §9 re-audit).
- **Markdown-level injection defense** — the runbook renderer (`render/copilot.py:_inline`)
  de-backticks/flattens every field, so untrusted text can't break out of a code span in the
  generated markdown (beyond the guardrail sanitization above).
- `needs-human-review` const — satisfied by our existing `verified | needs-review | rejected`
  status (§7.6 keeps ours over their const).

Deferred (tracked, not dropped) — both are infra, not engine code:

- **Full scan/publish credential split** — separate no-credential scan role + scoped publish role +
  CI wiring is deployment/infra per §7.7; the code-side pieces (allowlist, token-out-of-argv) are done.
- **Supply-chain pinning** — GitHub Actions are tag-pinned (not SHA-pinned) and deps are floor-pinned
  (not hashed); `resiliency-skills`' Renovate digest-pin + `--require-hashes` pattern is the lift target.

(§7.6 schema governance, originally slotted here, is **done** — see below.)

### Phase 2 — Status-aware trust spine ✅

- **Status-aware crossref** (`validation/crossref.py`) — a verified artifact that depends-on/implements
  a non-verified (or missing) referent is downgraded to needs-review, iterated to a fixpoint so the
  downgrade cascades. Monotonic/downgrade-only; only trust-dependency relations trigger it (back-links
  like alerts-on/covers don't). The orchestrator gating loop is now compute → downgrade → persist.
- **Provenance path confinement** (`validation/provenance.py`) — evidence paths must resolve inside the
  repo root (`is_relative_to`); `../` and absolute-path escapes are rejected.
- **Status-aware readiness** (`scoring/readiness.py`) — artifact-presence checks credit only verified
  coverage; a needs-review draft is a gap ("present but not yet verified"), never counted toward the
  grade. Recomputed in the orchestrator *after* gating so a downgrade is reflected.

### §7 enhancements landed alongside

- **§7.1 tier-conflict findings** ✅ — when Tier-A and Tier-B assert opposite presence for the same
  (concern, target), the validation report flags a `tier-conflict` instead of dropping the Tier-B
  signal (`reporting/findings.py`) — a near-zero-cost detector for Tier-A extraction bugs. Dormant
  until a Tier-B producer.
- **§7.2 tier-aware guardrails** ✅ — only Tier-A findings emit hard Copilot rules; Tier-B surfaces as
  advisory notes (`render/copilot.py`).
- **§7.3 non-circular contract testable** ✅ — an adversarial-LLM corpus
  (`tests/fixtures/adversarial-llm/`) of planted claims the cited code doesn't support; the challenge
  gate must reject/downgrade each (`tests/test_adversarial_llm.py`). Regression teeth before a live
  oracle — the dual of `examples/malicious/`. (Prerequisite for Phase 3.)
- **§7.4 shared signatures + re-derivation** ✅ — `sre_kb/signatures.py` is one library both tiers
  read: a `Signature` carries the annotation keys (Java AST) and call tokens (.NET AST) the Tier-A
  collectors key off, plus the text patterns Tier-B re-derives with. The challenge gate re-derives a
  ResiliencyPattern claim via "does the signature fire at the pointer?" not a substring, and
  `rederive()` is the Tier-B contract (§6.3 step 2) the Phase 4 gap-finder calls. One rule, both tiers.
- **§7.5 surface the trust tier** ✅ — the findings digest + PR `REVIEW.md` label each claim
  AST-grounded / LLM-proposed, with a by-tier roll-up. A shared `tiers.py` is the single source of truth.
- **§7.6 schema governance** ✅ — `additionalProperties: false` on every per-kind spec (positive
  allow-list), an `ownership` enum (app|platform|shared) and an `unverifiedAgainstLive` flag on the
  envelope, and a golden-example-per-kind corpus validated in CI (`tests/fixtures/golden/`).

### Phase 3 — Challenge loop (Copilot oracle) ✅

Built and exercised end-to-end (2026-06-07): a deterministic `GroundingChallenger` runs inline in the
orchestrator; `build_worklist` emits judgment-call claims (Alert appropriateness, Runbook safety) to
`challenge/worklist.json`; `challenge-worklist` shows them; Copilot adjudicates
(`supported|unsupported|contradicted`); `challenge-apply` re-gates with the **same monotonic
downgrade-only** rule and moves each artifact to its new status dir. The in-process `LLMChallenger`
class stays a **dormant hook** — the oracle is Copilot via the worklist, so the engine never calls a
model (the founding invariant). The §7.3 adversarial-LLM corpus is the regression harness.

> Verified live: on `sample-spring-pcf` the loop routed the `create-order-latency-burn-rate` Alert
> `verified → needs-review` when its burn-rate expr didn't measure the latency SLI it cited (now fixed).
>
> Two follow-on fixes hardened that derivation (`synth/scaffold.py:burn_rate_expr`): a latency SLO now
> burns on its histogram buckets (`*_bucket{le=<threshold>}`) rather than the request error ratio, and
> the burn-rate is **scoped to the flow's own route** (`uri="…"`) so a per-flow SLO is no longer
> measured service-wide. Covered by `tests/test_burn_rate_expr.py`.

### Phase 4 — Tier-B LLM gap-finder 🟡 (spike)

The first Tier-B collector, as a spike (`docs/PHASE-4-GAP-FINDER.md`). Copilot proposes resiliency
gaps the AST missed (§7.9 recall mode), quoting verbatim excerpts; the engine — never the LLM —
locates each (`collectors/llm/gap_finder.py`), stamps `path:line:hash` with `source_tier=llm`, and
runs a deterministic *refutation probe* via the shared `signatures.py` (§7.4): a `missing-timeout`
gap survives only if the `timeout` signature fires nowhere the engine `checked`. Survivors scaffold
to a `ResiliencyGap` artifact (new kind, golden-corpus + `additionalProperties:false`), forced to
`needs-review` / `unverifiedAgainstLive` — nothing it proposes can auto-verify. The recall eval
(`tests/test_gap_finder.py`, the dual of §7.3) plants a gap, a false positive, and a hallucination,
and asserts the engine surfaces the first and drops the other two. Prompt: the vendored
`assess-resiliency` skill (`.github/skills/sre-gap-finder/`). CLI: `sre-kb gap-finder`.

Grounded probes today: `missing-timeout` and `unguarded-critical-dependency` (refuted when
`circuit-breaker`/`fallback`/`timeout` fire), with **target-scoped** config probing (by resilience
instance name) and a **noise budget** (`gap_finder.max_candidates`, severity-ranked). Deferred from
§7.9/§7.10: probes for the remaining categories (`swallowed-failure` next — the cleanest graduation
instance), the graduation-to-Tier-A loop, and integration into the main `run` pipeline (the spike is
a standalone opt-in path).

### Phase 5 ⬜

Not started: render-adapter breadth (Wavefront / AppDynamics emitters beyond Splunk + Prometheus).

---

## 9. Reassessment & revised forward order (2026-06-07, post-spike)

A re-audit once the Phase 4 spike had landed and merged to `main`, on two axes: (a) a source-level
re-verification of every §8 claim, and (b) a strategic re-read of the plan now that the spike
*exists* rather than being the open risk it was framed as.

### 9.1 The plan's central bet has cleared its bar

The whole plan was sequenced around one make-or-break experiment — the fenced Tier-B gap-finder
(§6.3, §7.9). If the *non-circular contract* couldn't be made to work, "just extend
`resiliency-skills`" was the rational alternative (the framing in `REASSESSMENT-2026-06.md`). The
spike resolved it: its recall eval **surfaces a planted gap, refutes a false positive** (a timeout
*is* present → the shared signature fires → the gap is dropped), and **drops a hallucinated citation**
(anchor not found verbatim) — and the probe generalizes across Java *and* .NET. The architecture is
now *demonstrated*, not argued; that strategic question is closed in the plan's favor.

### 9.2 Deep-review verdict — §8 is trustworthy, and slightly understated

Every Phase 0–4 claim in §8 was re-verified at file:line: **zero drift.** The audit also surfaced
behaviors the code has but §8 hadn't recorded — now folded in: the dangerous-pattern **safety lint**
(`validation/safety.py`), **markdown-level injection defense** in the runbook renderer, the
honest-negative **`checked:` trail** on gap Facts, and the **`provenanceMode`** (`deterministic` |
`llm-asserted`) signal on the envelope. None change status; they make the doc match the code.

### 9.3 The revised order — *integrate before expand*

Phases 0–3 and every §7 enhancement are done and tested (178 green). What remains is **finishing a
proven architecture**, not de-risking an unproven one — which reorders the work. (This also finally
takes §7.7's standing advice that Phase 5 is independent and should run in parallel, not last.)

1. **Wire the gap-finder into `run`.** It is a standalone CLI/pipeline today (§8 Phase 4), so the
   shipped `sre-kb run` never surfaces Tier-B at all. Small, no new trust risk; turns the spike into
   a feature. *Highest impact-to-risk ratio of anything remaining.*
2. **`swallowed-failure` refutation probe** (the 3rd probe). The plan's own "natural next," and the
   cleanest **graduation exemplar**: re-run the deterministic swallow rule at the LLM's pointer and,
   *if it fires*, promote the finding to Tier-A.
3. **Graduation loop (§7.9).** Now buildable against the concrete instance from (2): a recurring,
   human-confirmed gap category becomes a deterministic signature, so the gap-finder *ratchets the
   engine's recall upward* instead of being a permanent crutch. The strategic core of Tier-B.
4. **Phase 5 render-adapter breadth.** Independent of the trust spine, zero LLM-trust risk, immediate
   user-visible value — run as a **parallel track**, not after Phase 4.
5. **Infra hardening** (full scan/publish credential split; supply-chain SHA-pinning +
   `--require-hashes`). Gate on intent to do **live (`--no-dry-run`) publishes** — it is the one open
   item that becomes a real safety bug the moment someone ships against a real target.

Net: (1) makes Tier-B real for users, (2)+(3) make it compound, (4) runs alongside, (5) lands before
the first live publish. The §6 phase *table* records the original sequence; this subsection is the
current one.
